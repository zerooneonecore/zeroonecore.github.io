  <p>So, back to the drawing board, I wanted a modular way of modifying programs for purposes of instrumentation,
    and knew that it would amount to editing a <i>section</i>. Though, this seemed to present its own problems,
    because its one thing to patch an instruction on an already compiled executable, its another to add new
    instructions, it might mean that every other address or relocation information past that line would
    need to be adjusted. <br>This was better than recompiling the entire program, but it certainly didn't 
    appear elegant. This suggested that the right tool for the job was breakpoints, and debuggers, and that
    perhaps its wiser to work within memory. </p>
