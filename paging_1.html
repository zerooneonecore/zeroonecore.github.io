<h1>Paging continued</h1>
  <p>There is no shortcut I have found for understanding the kernel, it is a diverse and, understandably
     idiosyncratic document.<br>
    <i><strong>#define PMD_SHIFT	(PAGE_SHIFT + (PTRS_PER_PTD_SHIFT))</i></strong><br>
    We will simply go through as much of the <strong>paging.h</strong> file as we can, (<i>arch ia64</i>),
    So what is <strong>PAGE_SHIFT</strong>? Well, it depends on the configuration, and the configuration,
    like many things, is best seen through a table.<br>
    <table class="format">
  <tr>
    <th>Configuration</th>
    <th>PAGE_SHIFT value</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CONFIG_IA64_PAGE_SIZE_4KB</td>
    <td>12</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CONFIG_IA64_PAGE_SIZE_8KB</td>
    <td>13</td>
  </tr>
     <tr>
    <td>CONFIG_IA64_PAGE_SIZE_16KB</td>
    <td>14</td>
  </tr>
     <tr>
    <td>CONFIG_IA64_PAGE_SIZE_64KB</td>
    <td>16</td>
  </tr>
</table><br>
    So clearly the page size or some fragment of that value is being set, but under what context? virtual? physical? It's best to see
    where these configuration parameters are being set. These are referenced in the Kconfig file, which
    makes sense, but when is this file read? Well this has to do with the build process and its beyond the
    scope of this topic, what is important is that these configuration parameters are set very early, 
  and therefore have a type of authority. Continuing to <strong>PTRS_PER_PTD_SHIFT</strong>, it expands
  to <strong>(PAGE_SHIFT-3</strong>, which means the entire expression expands to <strong>PAGE_SHIFT + (PAGE_SHIFT-3)</strong>
  I'm tempted to assume that this is equivalent to <strong>(2 * PAGE_SHIFT) - 3</strong>, though I am not
  sure why they do this, but it does look strange from an arithmetic perspective. Equally interesting along
  this observation is this line here <strong>hmm_pfn_flags_order(PMD_SHIFT - PAGE_SHIFT);</strong>
  Because if true, this would be equivalent to <strong>hmm_pfn_flags_order(PTRS_PER_PTD_SHIFT);</strong>
