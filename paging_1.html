<h1>Paging continued</h1>
  <p>There is no shortcut I have found for understanding the kernel, it is a diverse and, understandably
     idiosyncratic document.<br>
    <i><strong>#define PMD_SHIFT	(PAGE_SHIFT + (PTRS_PER_PTD_SHIFT))</i></strong><br>
    We will simply go through as much of the <strong>paging.h</strong> file as we can, (<i>arch ia64</i>),
    So what is <strong>PAGE_SHIFT</strong>? Well, it depends on the configuration, and the configuration,
    like many things, is best seen through a table.<br>
    <table class="format">
  <tr>
    <th>Configuration</th>
    <th>PAGE_SHIFT value</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CONFIG_IA64_PAGE_SIZE_4KB</td>
    <td>12</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CONFIG_IA64_PAGE_SIZE_8KB</td>
    <td>13</td>
  </tr>
     <tr>
    <td>CONFIG_IA64_PAGE_SIZE_16KB</td>
    <td>14</td>
  </tr>
     <tr>
    <td>CONFIG_IA64_PAGE_SIZE_64KB</td>
    <td>16</td>
  </tr>
</table><br>
    So clearly the page size or some fragment of that value is being set, but under what context? virtual? physical? It's best to see
    where these configuration parameters are being set. These are referenced in the Kconfig file, which
    makes sense, but when is this file read? Well this has to do with the build process and its beyond the
    scope of this topic, what is important is that these configuration parameters are set very early, 
  and therefore have a type of authority. Continuing to <strong>PTRS_PER_PTD_SHIFT</strong>, it expands
  to <strong>(PAGE_SHIFT-3</strong>, which means the entire expression expands to <strong>PAGE_SHIFT + (PAGE_SHIFT-3)</strong>
  I'm tempted to assume that this is equivalent to <strong>(2 * PAGE_SHIFT) - 3</strong>, though I am not
  sure why they do this, but it does look strange from an arithmetic perspective. Equally interesting along
  this observation is this line here <strong>hmm_pfn_flags_order(PMD_SHIFT - PAGE_SHIFT);</strong>
  Because if true, this would be equivalent to <span><i>hmm_pfn_flags_order(PTRS_PER_PTD_SHIFT);</i></span>
  Now then, where is <strong>PMD_SHIFT</strong> referenced? A lot of it is referenced in the <strong>ivt.S</strong>
  file, which concerns the interrupt vector tables, and a lot of interesting stuff is here. So in conclusion,
  the general pattern is that the masks are built via bitwise shifts, often in c source files, the bit
  setting is done via xor, AND, and frequently in assembly files, as this is where the architecture
  can be optimized. This makes sense, as the bit flags should be as invariant as possible, and flags
  are essentially another term for a mask. One difference between the language of masks and flags is that you can 
  mask something, <i>e.g, set a bit</i>, but you typically don't 'flag' something, you have flags that you can set.
