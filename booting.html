  <h1>The boot sequence</h1><br>
  Right so, where do we find the "bootcode" for the linux kernel? I found it really difficult to locate where
  the bootcode was, and decided to look into the build system. Makefiles and config files were scattered
  everywhere, and this wasn't seeming to yield any results. What I did know is that the kernel has to interface
  in some way with the BIOS/firmware, and decided to try searching "ROM, BIOS, firmware". An install script
  within the architecture specific directory for ia64 made a reference to <strong>"vmlinuz"</strong> 
  and <strong>"System.map"</strong>, which I could not find a reference for anywhere.
  I continued to dig around and finally found the ia64 file <strong>"/kernel/head.S"</strong>, with a
  promising note, (the way I had found this was by looking at a different architecture, x86, whos file
  names were much more illuminating, and then cross referencing these to the ia64 architecture files.)<br><br>
  
  <p class="source"><i>
 * Here is where the ball gets rolling as far as the kernel is concerned.
 * When control is transferred to _start, the bootload has already
 * loaded us to the correct address.  All that's left to do here is
 * to set up the kernel's global pointer and jump to the kernel
    * entry point.</i></p><br>
  The very first line, and a very common line is <strong>GLOBAL_ENTRY(_start)</strong> or <strong>ENTRY(arg)</strong>,
  the expansion is as follows.<br><br>
  <table class="source">
  <tr>
    <th>Macro Name</th>
    <th>Macro Definition</th>
    <th>Macro Expansion</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>GLOBAL_ENTRY(name)</td>
    <td>.global name;<br>			
	      ENTRY(name)</td>
    <td>.global name;<br>
	 .align 32;<br>			
	 .proc name;<br>				
          name:<br><br>
	  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ENTRY(name)</td>
    <td>.align 32;<br>			
	       .proc name;<br>

    <td>.align 32;<br>

	</table><br><strong>.global <i>symbol</i></strong> is what is known as an <i>assembler directive</i>, with respect to the
	assembler <strong>as</strong>, it makes the symbol <strong><i>symbol</i></strong> visible to the linker
	<strong>ld</strong>. What does this mean, visible? Well clearly we need to know something about 
	<strong>ld</strong>. I found this statement kind of baffling, what does that mean, visible to ld?
	does it mean ld can manipulate it? or that statements involving that symbol are interpreted by ld?
	admittedly the latter is less likely. I suppose we need to refresh ourselves on what <i>ld</i> does,
	the <i>man page</i> mentions <i> ld combines a number of object and archive files</i>, ld essentially
	takes names in the object files, and binds them to addresses or the means to obtain an address.
	So what is the purpose behind combining multiple object files? why not just one? Does this mean we
	can link two arbitrary object files together? I linked two arbitrary object files together with
	the command <strong><i>ld -o output bytes.o helloworld.o -lc</i></strong>, which worked perfectly
	except for having to remove a duplicate main() symbol. As in, the "main" routine is really just
	an ordinary function, so it can't be defined twice when linking two object files together.
	The result of linking both object files together is that both functions from each linked object file
	were available in the outputted object file. <i>readelf</i> and other utilites read the file 
	as an executable, but apparently an executable can be completely useless, as i was not expecting
	the following output.<br>
	<br><p class="source"><strong>file output</strong><br>
output: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld64.so.1, not stripped<br>
		<strong>./output</strong><br>
		<i>bash: ./output: No such file or directory</i>
