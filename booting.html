  <h1>The boot sequence</h1><br>
  Right so, where do we find the "bootcode" for the linux kernel? I found it really difficult to locate where
  the bootcode was, and decided to look into the build system. Makefiles and config files were scattered
  everywhere, and this wasn't seeming to yield any results. What I did know is that the kernel has to interface
  in some way with the BIOS/firmware, and decided to try searching "ROM, BIOS, firmware". An install script
  within the architecture specific directory for ia64 made a reference to <strong>"vmlinuz"</strong> and <strong>"System.map"</strong>
  I continued to dig around and finally found the ia64 file <strong>"/kernel/head.S"</strong>, with a
  promising note<br>
  
  <p class="source"><i>
 * Here is where the ball gets rolling as far as the kernel is concerned.
 * When control is transferred to _start, the bootload has already
 * loaded us to the correct address.  All that's left to do here is
 * to set up the kernel's global pointer and jump to the kernel
    * entry point.</i></p>
