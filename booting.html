  <h1>The boot sequence</h1><br>
  Right so, where do we find the "bootcode" for the linux kernel? I found it really difficult to locate where
  the bootcode was, and decided to look into the build system. Makefiles and config files were scattered
  everywhere, and this wasn't seeming to yield any results. What I did know is that the kernel has to interface
  in some way with the BIOS/firmware, and decided to try searching "ROM, BIOS, firmware". An install script
  within the architecture specific directory for ia64 made a reference to <strong>"vmlinuz"</strong> and <strong>"System.map"</strong>
