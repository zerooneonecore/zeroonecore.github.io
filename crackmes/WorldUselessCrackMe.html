  <h1>AzarAbdulla's World Useless Crack Me</h1><br>
  <p>The last crackme was rough, mostly as a result of decoding the assembly, I admit if a decompiler was
     used it would have been easier, but I haven't got the greatest confidence that decompilers have solved
     the problem of optimization and so have decided that nurturing an understanding of assembly is worth
    the time. The names were mangled, and the gdb setting <i>set print asm-demangle on</i>
    actually worked. However the program seemed to be C++ which I was unfamiliar with. 
    I first wanted to find where the 'Try' string was originating from, and my first instinct was to 
    breakpoint right before the printing, but then I realized that due to C++'s object oriented nature, it might 
    be written to the object earlier than i expect, with its constructors and what not.
