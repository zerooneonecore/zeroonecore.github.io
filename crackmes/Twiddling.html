  <h1>machinas's 'Twiddling'</h1><br>
  <p>
  So the author provides a hint which is that this crackme somehow relates to 'bit twiddling', or working with bits.
  The author has just riddled this binary with function calls of various taunting names. I wasn't having
  the best of luck finding the success function, so I decided to just start understanding the code from
  the beginning. What is rather interesting however, is that the author implemented a parser, albeit a simple
  one, but a parser rather than just asking for the flag in a commandline argument. So far so good with the
  data flow of the program.
  <br><br><p class="source">
  (gdb) x $rdi<br>
  0x7fffffffde10:	102 'f'<br>
  (gdb) x $rdi+1<br>
  0x7fffffffde11:	108 'l'<br>
  (gdb) x $rdi+2<br>
  0x7fffffffde12:	97 'a'<br>
  </p><br><br>
  This is the data that would be read by the <i>stod()</i> function call to follow. the stod function would
  then read the user input itself, shown following
  <br><br><p class="source">
  (gdb) x $rdi+1<br>
0x7fffffffde11:	65 'A'<br>
(gdb) x $rdi+2<br>
0x7fffffffde12:	65 'A'<br>
(gdb) x $rdi+3<br>
0x7fffffffde13:	65 'A'<br>
(gdb) x $rdi+4
0x7fffffffde14:	10 '\n'<br>
  </p><br><br>
  So far as I can tell, all <i>stod()</i> does is read the string. After the call to <i>strlen()</i>, the program
  compares the string length with 0x20=32, presumably for the benefit of the bit twiddling routines to come?
  So the string definitely needs to be 31 characters long excluding newline. <i>this_is_where_the_fun_begins()</i>
  then starts off with a far jump. From here <i>ive_never_been_stung_by_a_wasp()</i> is called with the first
  character of the user supplied string. <i>ive_never_been_stung_by_a_wasp()</i> is called several times
  throughout the program, so I thought it might be helpful to observe its various return values to see if any
  pattern arises. 
  <br><br> 
  <table class="source">
  <tr>
    <th>function</th>
    <th>call #</th>
    <th>return value</th>
    <th>input string</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ive_never_been_stung_by_a_wasp()</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0000000000000000000000000100001000000000000000000000000001000010</td>
    <td>BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ive_never_been_stung_by_a_wasp()</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>0000000000000000000000000100001000000000000000000000000001000010</td>
      <td>BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>ive_never_been_stung_by_a_wasp()</td>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>0000000000000000000000000100001000000000000000000000000001000010</td>
      <td>BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB</td>
    </tr>
 </table><br>
  So I'm not quite sure what to think of that, I know the return value is in rax, and I was under the impression
  that that is what remain after a function call, so if it does any work, it would remain on the stack.
  <i>you_turn_my_world_around()</i> is called with the same bit string as in the table above.
  Now as far as the actual success string, it is printed by the first <i>printf()</i>, and the failure string,
  by the second <i>printf()</i>, I may experiment putting this information in a graph because its becoming
  quite complex.

  <br>
  After founding the register where the comparison to the victory code path is done, I noticed that its 
  bit string value does not vary at all when the flag input is random strings. In addition this value
  is set within the <i>this_is_where_the_fun_begins()</i> function and only incremented a few times after that.
  This indicated that the algorithm to generate this bit string is exact, and done fully within the 
  <i>this_is_where_the_fun_begins()</i> function.
  <br>
  ...
  I really need to get some sort of system for doing this, solving these things is beginning to become a function
  of debugging them enough times to where I have some mental map of what is going on, until I can piece it together,
  
  After enough frustration I decided to read a writeup on this, and that my mistake is trying to decompile
  assembly code myself, the code itself was quite simple, but it felt like a labrynth of complexity, to get 
  absolutely anywhere in this business, you need a decompiler, lesson learned.
