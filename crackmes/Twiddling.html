  <h1>machinas's 'Twiddling'</h1><br>
  <p>
  So the author provides a hint which is that this crackme somehow relates to 'bit twiddling', or working with bits.
  The author has just riddled this binary with function calls of various taunting names. I wasn't having
  the best of luck finding the success function, so I decided to just start understanding the code from
  the beginning. What is rather interesting however, is that the author implemented a parser, albeit a simple
  one, but a parser rather than just asking for the flag in a commandline argument. So far so good with the
  data flow of the program.
  <br><br><p class="source">
  (gdb) x $rdi<br>
  0x7fffffffde10:	102 'f'<br>
  (gdb) x $rdi+1<br>
  0x7fffffffde11:	108 'l'<br>
  (gdb) x $rdi+2<br>
  0x7fffffffde12:	97 'a'<br>
  </p><br><br>
  This is the data that would be read by the <i>stod()</i> function call to follow.
