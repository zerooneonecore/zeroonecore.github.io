  <h1>machinas's 'Twiddling'</h1><br>
  <p>
  So the author provides a hint which is that this crackme somehow relates to 'bit twiddling', or working with bits.
  The author has just riddled this binary with function calls of various taunting names. I wasn't having
  the best of luck finding the success function, so I decided to just start understanding the code from
  the beginning. What is rather interesting however, is that the author implemented a parser, albeit a simple
  one, but a parser rather than just asking for the flag in a commandline argument.
