  <h1>4N0NY31TY's First Crackme</h1><br>
  <p>First things first, we run the program, and see that it takes only a single argument, the license key.
    The next thing I'll do is load it into a debugger <i>gdb</i> and check for any calls to <i>strmcp()</i>
    The program was much more complex than i was expecting, with calls to functions like <i>malloc()</i>,
    <i>realloc()</i>, and some user created functions. There were several calls to <i>printf()</i>
    and <i>puts()</i> so I decided to map these out by setting breakpoints. After the first call to
    <i>printf()</i>, nothing was printed, which was unexpected. After trying to override a cmp instruction,
    it resulted in a segmentation fault, so I opted instead to try to recover the arguments passed to the
    different functions. At this point I was confident that the license check routine was performed within
    the <i>input()</i> function.<br><br>
    <i>malloc()</i> took a single argument, a <i>size</i> argument, and I wanted to see if this varied
    based on the user input. The <i>malloc()</i> call occurred before the reading of the license key, so
    it must be hardcoded.
