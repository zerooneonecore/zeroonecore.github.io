  <h1>4N0NY31TY's First Crackme</h1><br>
  <p>First things first, we run the program, and see that it takes only a single argument, the license key.
    The next thing I'll do is load it into a debugger <i>gdb</i> and check for any calls to <i>strmcp()</i>
    The program was much more complex than i was expecting, with calls to functions like <i>malloc()</i>,
    <i>realloc()</i>, and some user created functions. There were several calls to <i>printf()</i>
    and <i>puts()</i> so I decided to map these out by setting breakpoints. After the first call to
    <i>printf()</i>, nothing was printed, which was unexpected. After trying to override a cmp instruction,
    it resulted in a segmentation fault, so I opted instead to try to recover the arguments passed to the
    different functions. At this point I was confident that the license check routine was performed within
    the <i>input()</i> function.<br><br>
    <i>malloc()</i> took a single argument, a <i>size</i> argument, and I wanted to see if this varied
    based on the user input. The <i>malloc()</i> call occurred before the reading of the license key, so
    it must be hardcoded. I examined the memory of the address returned by <i>malloc()</i>, and much of it
    was zeros, while <i>malloc()</i> has been known to do this, as a sanity check I examined the heap section
    based on the info provided by <i><strong>info proc mappings</strong></i> within <i>gdb</i>
    I subtracted the addresses of the heap section provided by the memory map of the program with the following
    output.<br><br> 
    <p class="source">p 0x55555555a000-0x555555559000<br>
                        $35 = 4096
    </p><br>
    4096 was a nice number to see, as it seemed to be aligned to a page size. Next I wanted to see if the
  address returned by <i>malloc()</i> was inclusive to this range, and figured that the difference must be
  to the expression 0&lt;d&lt;4096. (Output listed below)<br>
  <br><p class="source">p 0x55555555a000-0x5555555596b0<br>
                      $38 = 2384<br>
    </p><br>
    This confirmed that it was definitely within the heap section, and that this indeed was the address
  returned by <i>malloc()</i>. What followed was a call to <i>getchar()</i> and since this function took
  no arguments, it was not of any interest. What followed from here was a <i>getchar() loop</i>, and while
  its possible that data could be altered within the loop, I opted to assume that it was normal. The prior
  assumption that it was a normal <i>getchar()</i> loop was looking to be false, and upon further thought
  I realized that if the algorithm operated on characters, it would make sense that it would occur within
  the <i>getchar()</i> loop. At this point I sort of got lost, and decided to see if I could find if the
  'success' string was in memory to locate the right <i>print()</i> function. This took longer than
  I'd like to admit, but I finally found the decisive jump after wrestling with casting and gdb for awhile.
  <br>
  At this point I had walked away and upon return was struggling once more with casting, and decided
  to override the cmp instruction more directly, using flags. Except there was way too many flags,
  so I decided to just jump to that location using gdb, to find that that was the place where the success
  message was printed ,admittedly I did not know that <i>gdb</i> could do this.<br>
  Simply just understanding the assembly was becoming exhausting and I was in over my head, so I went
  back to the drawing board and opted to comment everything. Except gdb did not support comments.
  So the second to last resort was to essentially rebuild the program, the last resort being decompilation.
  
  <br>
  <p class="source">
    <i>set up stack</i><br>
    <i>read prompt message</i><br>
    <i>call input()</i><br>
    <i>input(): set up hardcoded arguments for printf()</i><br>
    <i>input(): allocate 20 bytes on heap with malloc()</i><br>
    <i>input(): getchar() loop until newline character 0xa</i><br>
    <i>input(): return length of string not including newline</i>
    <i>after input() routine, return user string in rax register</i>
    <i>perform basic len() checks*</i>

  </p><br>
  At this point I was struggling because I was unable to read the assembly, and decided that I needed to
  improve in this area, so I would return to this at a later date, and in the mean time practice
  reading assembly from compiled c code. Now I was finally getting to the algorithm, it multiplied the
  string length (newline exclusive), by a value 0xfffffff6, and then added a value 0x34e7, then compared
  this to a value on the stack, all I had to do now was figure out how this value was being generated.
  This helped, for a little bit, but then I was stuck again, I moved to rigorously testing my assumptions
  about the program using conditional breakpoints and watchpoints.
  Update, I believe that the algorithm is <i>((strlen(user input) * 0xfffffff6) + 0x34e7) == map(ascii())</i>
  I've gotten to the point where i can consistently override the program, as well, which is binary patching, is
  progress. 
  <br><p class="source">
  (gdb) p/d ($eax-0x34e7)/0xfffffff6<br>
             $119 = 1<br>
  (gdb) x $rbp-0x10<br>
   0x7fffffffde30:	107<br>
 </p><br>
  I was brazen enough to assume the '/' operator as an inverse function of imul, but it seemed to work
  in this case. I also had learned that the comparison value was being generated by repeatedly adding the ascii
  values of the characters. But was unsure of how overflow operated with this mechanism, to test this theory
  out I used the smallest ascii value I could to prevent overflow,
  <br><br><p class="source">
  (gdb) x/d $rbp-0x10
0x7fffffffde30:	66<br>
(gdb) p/d '!'<br>
$153 = 33
  </p><br>
  For me this was convincing, since you could clearly see that 66 was a multiple of 33, or '!'
  But even further I had learned that the value is the sum of all the ascii values of the supplied string.
  One thing that is rather peculiar about the 0xfffffff6 value, is that interpreted as a <i>long int</i>,
  it is almost exactly twice the maximum integer a 32 bit value, can hold, or 2,147,483,647, the value being
  4,294,967,286. Now I have updated the algorithm, not knowing if it is exactly accurate, but it is within bounds
  I believe,
  <br><br><p class="source">
  <i>[13453 - 10 * strlen(input)] == map(ascii())</i>
       </p><br>
  After a little trial and error, as per about 10-15 iterations of adjusting the last character of a string,
  I finally produced a winning value. 
  <br><br><p class="source">
     ./crackme 
Enter License: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~E<br>
<br>
License is valid!<br>
  </p><br>
  Now, while there is some interesting mathematical material to be explored here, perhaps with the chinese
  remainder theorem, I decided one solution was enough for now and may return to this at a later date.
