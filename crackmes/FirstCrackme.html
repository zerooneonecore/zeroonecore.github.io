  <h1>4N0NY31TY's First Crackme</h1><br>
  <p>First things first, we run the program, and see that it takes only a single argument, the license key.
    The next thing I'll do is load it into a debugger <i>gdb</i> and check for any calls to <i>strmcp()</i>
    The program was much more complex than i was expecting, with calls to functions like <i>malloc()</i>,
    <i>realloc()</i>, and some user created functions. There were several calls to <i>printf()</i>
    and <i>puts()</i> so I decided to map these out by setting breakpoints. After the first call to
    <i>printf()</i>, nothing was printed, which was unexpected.
