  <p>First things first, we run the binary, and see that it asks for three arguments, a username, a 
     number, and a password. There are several calls to print functions and input functions, in this case
    <i>scanf</i>. Now usually the last function called before exiting is a print function, so the first
     thing I'm going to look for is a kind of far jump to the last or a later print function.
     This turns out to be a fruitful idea, as putting a breakpoint in an area fitting this criteria
    indeed resulted in a jump to the "wrong password" message. This led to a rapid success, as ultimately
    it didn't matter what the nature of the algorithm was, only that it was using strcmp(), and involved comparing
    two registers, which could easily be overrided. 
    However, there could be a more mathematical nature to this algorithm, in the sense that
    we have obtained only one solution.
