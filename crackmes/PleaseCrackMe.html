  <h1>RaphDev's PleaseCrackMe</h1><br>
  <p>First things first, we run the binary, and see that it asks for three arguments, a username, a 
     number, and a password. There are several calls to print functions and input functions, in this case
    <i>scanf</i>. Now usually the last function called before exiting is a print function, so the first
     thing I'm going to look for is a kind of far jump to the last or a later print function.
     This turns out to be a fruitful idea, as putting a breakpoint in an area fitting this criteria
    indeed resulted in a jump to the "wrong password" message. This led to a rapid success, as ultimately
    it didn't matter what the nature of the algorithm was, only that it was using strcmp(), and involved comparing
    two registers, which could easily be overrided.<br><br>
    However, there could be a more mathematical nature to this algorithm, in the sense that
    we have obtained only one solution. This was definitely the case, as the password changed depending
    on the arguments. However, the rapid bypass did provide one advantage, which is that all we needed
    to do was backtrack relative to the register with the password and see if we could figure out
    the algorithm. After staring at assembly code for a bit, I decided to backtrack until before
    the stack was written with the password. Within this program, there were three calls to <i>scanf</i>, 
    and there are two possibilities here, either data is permuted in between the calls to <i>scanf</i>, 
    or after all three. I assumed the latter option was more likely. I should mention as well that
    the three calls to <i>scanf</i> line up with the three items of user input, the name, digit, and password.
    This assumption was wishful thinking, and turned out to be categorically false.
    <br>
    At this point, I opted to see what data transformations were happening after each call to <i>scanf()</i>.
    This turned out to be utterly exhausting, reading assembly was like overclocking my brain, so I decided
    to gather data from the program.<br>
    <table class="source">
  <tr>
    <th>Username</th>
    <th>Digit</th>
    <th>Password</th>
    <th>Actual Password</th>

    <td>Two</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Two</td>
    <td>Vyq</td>
  </tr>

    <td>2</td>
    <td>Four</td>
    <td>Vyq</td>

    <td>2</td>
    <td>Two</td>

     <td>2</td>
     <td>Two</td>
     <td>Ugxgp</td>

    <tr>

     <td>2</td>
     <td>Two</td>
     <td>Gngxgp</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Thirten</td>
     <td>2</td>
     <td>Two</td>
     <td>Vjktvgp</td>

     <td>2</td>
     <td>Two</td>
     <td>Vjktxgp</td>

   <tr>
     <td>ven</td>
     <td>2</td>
     <td>Two</td>
     <td>xgp</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>

     <td>2</td>
     <td>Two</td>
     <td>xgpVjkt</td>
   </tr>
 </table>
     </p><br>
  <p>One observation was definitely apparent, the length of the password was directly proportional to the length
     of the username.
