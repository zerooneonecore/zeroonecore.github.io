  <h1>RaphDev's PleaseCrackMe</h1><br>
  <p>First things first, we run the binary, and see that it asks for three arguments, a username, a 
     number, and a password. There are several calls to print functions and input functions, in this case
    <i>scanf</i>. Now usually the last function called before exiting is a print function, so the first
     thing I'm going to look for is a kind of far jump to the last or a later print function.
     This turns out to be a fruitful idea, as putting a breakpoint in an area fitting this criteria
    indeed resulted in a jump to the "wrong password" message.
