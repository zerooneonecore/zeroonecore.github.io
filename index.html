<h1>I am sure this will become prettier over time.</h1>
  <p>This shall be the beginning of our reverse engineering journey</p>
  <p id="code_1"><span>#include <stdio.h></span>  
    <br><br><span>int main() {</span><br>
    <span>printf("Hello, World\n");</span><br><br>
    <span>}</span>
    </span>
  </p>
  <span>What does it mean to 'reverse engineer' this?</span>
  <span>We will be using the c compiler gcc</span>
  <p>First, we compile with flags -Og, flags are options given
    to programs on the commandline or terminal before execution
    The flag -O*, is a flag controlling optimization, the possible values
    for *, with respect to optimization levels are 0, 1, 2, 3 and g, we will
    be using g for the debugging level of optimization, as it is what gcc recommends.</p>
    <p>Our 'reverse engineering' will consist of starting with prior knowledge 
      of the printf function, and finding it within the assembly language.
      <span>Essentially we will wish to know, what function is called, and with what
        argument?</span>The first question can be answered at once by showing the assembly code,
      which we can do with the following command, <i>objdump -M intel -d filename</i>
      The M flag says which syntax to use, and the d flag tells objdump to print the
      assembly language associated with this executable file. 
      Without further ado, the output,
  <p id="code_2"><span>0000000000001149 \<main\>:</span><br>
    <span>1149:	f3 0f 1e fa          	endbr64</span><br>
    <span>114d:	55                   	push   rbp</span><br>
    <span>114e:	48 89 e5             	mov    rbp,rsp</span><br>
    <span>1151:	48 8d 3d ac 0e 00 00 	lea    rdi,[rip+0xeac]        # 2004 <_IO_stdin_used+0x4></span><br>
      <span>1158:	e8 f3 fe ff ff       	call   1050 \<puts@plt\></span><br>
  </p>
  <p>What we notice is that 'puts' is similar to 'printf', but how do we know that they have a relationship?
     It is because an optimization of gcc is to replace a call to printf, with a call to puts, it is rather
    fortunate that they are rather similar words, then what of the argument to printf?</p>
    Answering this question would be dependent on understanding how address space is allocated,
    and memory divided up, this would be outside the scope of a first post.
