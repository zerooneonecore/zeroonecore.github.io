<h1>
 Dealing with bytes
 </h1>
  <p>The goal here is to develop some facilities to make working with bytes easier, to facilitate
     the creation of an ELF file from the structs defined within the header files.<br>
     The first challenge here is to calculate accurately the size of a partial struct, where a partial
     struct is a struct, including its first member, truncated to some subsequent member. This may 
     appear to be something of a non sequitur, but if we needed to calculate the size of a 'full struct',
     the sizeof() function can return this trivially. If the struct is padded to an even byte multiple,
     then this isn't so difficult, so the task is to determine if a struct is padded.
