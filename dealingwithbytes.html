<h1>
 Dealing with bytes
 </h1>
  <p>The goal here is to develop some facilities to make working with bytes easier, to facilitate
     the creation of an ELF file from the structs defined within the header files.<br>
     The first challenge here is to calculate accurately the size of a partial struct, where a partial
     struct is a struct, including its first member, truncated to some subsequent member. This may 
     appear to be something of a non sequitur, but if we needed to calculate the size of a 'full struct',
     the sizeof() function can return this trivially. If the struct is padded to an even byte multiple,
     then this isn't so difficult, so the task is to determine if a struct is padded. 
     I first explored whether this was necessary, and found examples where structs were indeed padded by
     the compiler without special settings but could be padded to different multiples, e.g, <i>4 or 8</i>.
     Which means given sizeof(A) = 16 for example, we cannot make the assumption as to how many members A
     it has, as there are different possibilities, for example,
  <p id="math_1"><i><strong>16 = 4 * 4 = 8 * 2 = 8 + 4 + 4</i></strong></p><br>
    Fortunately, or well, theoretically we don't actually need to deal with a 'partial struct', because
    the section header table and program header table each are their own struct as per <i>man elf</i>, 
    hence as long as offsets are calculated to a struct and not its subsequent members, the sizeof()
    function should work wonderfully for calculating the offsets.
    The ELF header table has been more or less covered, the next order of business is the program
  header table. The two problematic fields are <i>p_vaddr</i>, and <i>p_offset</i>. The
  <i>man elf</i> entry does not provide much information as to what constitutes a virtual address, so
   we may have to consult the ELF specification for this. The ELF specification did not provide much
   actionable or at least obvious information about p_vaddr, so I decided the easiest way to figure
   this out would be to compile different types of executables, and study the program header tables of them.
  The first program I would compile would be one with hardcoded addresses, referred to as a 'statically 
  linked program'. I used the <i>objdump</i> utility rather than <i>readelf</i> because I found the output
  more intelligible.
