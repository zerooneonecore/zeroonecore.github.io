<h1>Rudimentary Encryption</h1>
<p>Encryption is the means to obfuscate data, but also to recover it.<br>
   A rudimentary form of encryption is the bitwise exclusive or, or "XOR" operation,
   bitwise meaning that it operates on bits. an odd number of truth values is true,
   and an even number is false. There are a couple of interesting features of xor,
   on their own.<br>For instance A xor A is all zeros, and A xor !A or ("not A") is all ones.<br>
   Hence, an encryption scheme can use the bitwise negation, to actually encrypt the data,
   and there exists a way to recover the data, since<br> ((A xor !A) xor !A) == A
   If this were implemented as a runtime decryption routine, "reverse engineering" it would depend on recognizing
   the bitwise negation, and xor instructions.</p>
