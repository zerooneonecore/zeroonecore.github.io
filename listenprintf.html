  <h1>"Hooking" standard output</h1><br>
  <p>It's not exactly clear to me what I'm even trying to do here. I want to listen to standard output,
     and I want some indication of when the contents of standard output changes, without resorting to 
     a while loop that continuously polls standard output or its associated buffer. I guess the first
    question is what information about the callee of a read/write to standard output does ... standard
    output provide? I came across this intriguing line from the wikipedia article on file descriptors,
    <br><p class="source"><i>The program requests data transfer with the write operation.</i></p></br>
    Did this mean that the write syscall acted as a bonafide representative of writing to standard output?
    I next came across this line from a linux journal article regarding FILE streams, 
    <br><br><p class="source"><i>The user perceives a STREAM as a file.<br>
                           It is handled with the usual open, read, write, ioctl and close system calls.</i></p></br>
    This should mean that a write syscall should be all that is necessary to monitor when inferring a write
    to standard output since no other writers exist. Our problem then reduces, or perhaps increases, 
    to that of monitoring userspace programs for syscalls. So, how do user space programs call system
    calls, and furthermore, will this produce any problems for the stack trace mechanism? I had read that
  glibc had wrappers for syscalls, and this would simplify things since uhh, it would give the name of
  a function to monitor, rather than having to wait for some specific assembly instructions/opcodes.
  The more I read, the more it was looking as if i would have to solely monitor syscall(), or syscall() and
  whatever glibs wrapper for the write syscall was, if it did exist.
