  <h1>"Hooking" standard output</h1><br>
  <p>It's not exactly clear to me what I'm even trying to do here. I want to listen to standard output,
     and I want some indication of when the contents of standard output changes, without resorting to 
     a while loop that continuously polls standard output or its associated buffer. I guess the first
    question is what information about the callee of a read/write to standard output does ... standard
    output provide? I came across this intriguing line from the wikipedia article on file descriptors,
    <br><p class="source"><i>The program requests data transfer with the write operation.</i></p></br>
    Did this mean that the write syscall acted as a bonafide representative of writing to standard output?
    I next came across this line from a linux journal article regarding FILE streams, 
    <br><br><p class="source"><i>The user perceives a STREAM as a file.<br>
                           It is handled with the usual open, read, write, ioctl and close system calls.</i></p></br>
    This should mean that a write syscall should be all that is necessary to monitor when inferring a write
    to standard output since no other writers exist. Our problem then reduces, or perhaps increases, 
    to that of monitoring userspace programs for syscalls.
