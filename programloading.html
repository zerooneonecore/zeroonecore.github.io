  <h1>The meaning of 0x400000</h1>
  <p>Really, the only proper way to figure out what 0x400000 means is to understand how memory addresses
     work under linux, which will probably be a huge tangent but interesting and fruitful in itself.
     So the core of this is the MMU, which translates virtual addresses to physical addresses, an ubiquitious
     description. The next question is whether the MMU uses segmentation or paging on x86-64, and the answer
     is that it does not use segmentation in '64 bit mode'. Hence our question reduces to figuring out paging.
     The entry point to the paging system is really the TLB, a cache, if there is a cache hit, then the
     translated address is returned immediately, if there is a cache miss, then the address will have to be
     computed following. The paging language refers to 'levels', and what this refers to is different
     levels of a tree structure. Software is not a static entity, so it is not unusual that multiple levels
     of a tree data structure could grow in the future, the common description, however, is in terms of
     three level page hierarchies. As per having a page global directory, page middle directory, and
     page table entry. These are in depth first order ... Anyway, so we have these concepts floating around,
     but how do we connect them to something substantive? Another tangent. We have to consider the origin of
     the paging information, or at least the entrance from userspace, the process. The indirection is
    task_struct->mm->pgd (<i>Notice pgd: "page global directory"</i>), after this indirection, the 
    connection to pmd and pte seemed to disperse into a set of functions. Where that leaves us is with
    <i><strong>pgtable.h</strong></i>, described as<br>
    <p class="source"><i>This file contains the functions and defines necessary to modify and use
      * the IA-64 page table tree.</i></p><br>
  The <i><strong>pgtable.h</strong></i> file under arch <i>ia64</i> starts by defining various "bits", but
  what is interesting here is that they aren't bits in a literal sense. For example, take the line
  <p class="source"><i>#define _PAGE_A_BIT		5</i></p><br>
    Now, clearly _PAGE_A_BIT isn't actually a bit in that 5 in binary is 101, not a single bit, but it is a
    means to set a bit. Rather it is more like a name for a state, it allows to ask whether _PAGE_A_BIT
    is set or not. The way it is used to set a bit is as follows,
    <p class="source"><i>#define _PAGE_A			(1 << _PAGE_A_BIT)	/* page accessed bit */</i></p><br>
    So what exactly is the role that '<<' is playing? First of all lets refresh ourselves a bit on bits.
  if we initialize a <i>long long int = 1</i>, it will be what we expect, the entire datum will be 1,
  but if we initialize an <i>int = 1</i>, the lower order bits is what will be used, the rest wont be
  zero, so something always to keep in mind. So lets look at the shifting in action.</p>
