  <h1>The meaning of 0x400000</h1>
  <p>Really, the only proper way to figure out what 0x400000 means is to understand how memory addresses
     work under linux, which will probably be a huge tangent but interesting and fruitful in itself.
     So the core of this is the MMU, which translates virtual addresses to physical addresses, an ubiquitious
     description. The next question is whether the MMU uses segmentation or paging on x86-64, and the answer
     is that it does not use segmentation in '64 bit mode'. Hence our question reduces to figuring out paging.
     The entry point to the paging system is really the TLB, a cache, if there is a cache hit, then the
     translated address is returned immediately, if there is a cache miss, then the address will have to be
     computed following. The paging language refers to 'levels', and what this refers to is different
     levels of a tree structure. Software is not a static entity, so it is not unusual that multiple levels
     of a tree data structure could grow in the future, the common description, however, is in terms of
     three level page hierarchies. As per having a page global directory, page middle directory, and
     page table entry. These are in depth first order,
