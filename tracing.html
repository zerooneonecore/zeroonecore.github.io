  <h1>Tracing programs, maybe gdb</h1><br>
  
  Anyway, so lets trace some syscalls with strace, lets trace gdb. First of all, running the command
  <strong>strace gdb</strong> will make gdb unuseable, it will essentially just completely take over
  standard output. The better way to go about it is <strong>strace --attach=&lt;pid&gt;</strong>, then you will be
  privy to the sea of output from strace. So first of all we know that we want to trace only the <strong>write()</strong>
  system call, so maybe strace can be filtered on its system calls. This doesn't scratch the surface of the
  <strong>--trace</strong> option, but we can filter on the <i>write()</i> syscall with the following command,
  <br><strong>sudo strace --trace=<i>write</i> --attach=&lt;pid&gt;</strong>, this works as intended for
  tracing only the <i>write()</i> syscall, however it captures any write, and the writes with a single character
  are not of interest to me, so maybe we can filter this out too. I didn't see any option to filter on
  arguments, so its time to proceed to the stack tracing option of <i>strace</i>. The full command is
  <strong>sudo strace --stack-traces --trace=write --attach=&lt;pid&gt;</strong>. This actually worked
  rather nicely, it was producing stack traces, which I had to remind myself are read from bottom to top,
  terminating on the <i>write()</i> syscall.

  <h2>Examining stack traces</h2>
  
  The goal now was to figure out what I wanted to know from the stack traces, of course, a different stack trace
  would be produced from a different result in gdb. For example, the stack trace on <strong>run</strong>
  with no arguments results in the following output.
  <br><br><p class="source"><i>gdb(print_exception(ui_file*, gdb_exception const&)+0x4a) [0x21078a]<br>
                                gdb(start_event_loop() [clone .cold]+0x1e) [0xc5fe2]
      </i></p><br>
  This suggested that the exception for a missing file in <i>run</i> was thrown from within the <i>start_event_loop()</i>
  function. Now it was time to see whether <i>print_exception()</i> would occur in a stack trace with an
  existing file. It seemed to disappear with a working program, but I wasn't fully confident, because it was
  an absurd amount of output, most if it from gdb rather than shared libraries. So I decided to return
  to the original useless executable. I knew the specific error message that was being printed, and this
  indeed was found within the stack trace, so I decided to log the strace output and begin to grep.
  This indeed confirmed that <i>print_exception()</i> was the relevant function and that it was called
  from within <i>start_event_loop()</i>. <i>start_event_loop()</i> was defined within the file
  <strong><i>gdb/event-loop.c</i></strong>.
