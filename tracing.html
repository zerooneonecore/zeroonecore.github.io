  <h1>Tracing programs, maybe gdb</h1><br>
  
  Anyway, so lets trace some syscalls with strace, lets trace gdb. First of all, running the command
  <strong>strace gdb</strong> will make gdb unuseable, it will essentially just completely take over
  standard output. The better way to go about it is <strong>strace --attach=&lt;pid&gt;</strong>, then you will be
  privy to the sea of output from strace. So first of all we know that we want to trace only the <strong>write()</strong>
  system call, so maybe strace can be filtered on its system calls. This doesn't scratch the surface of the
  <strong>--trace</strong> option, but we can filter on the <i>write()</i> syscall with the following command,
  <br><strong>sudo strace --trace=<i>write</i> --attach=&lt;pid&gt;</strong>, this works as intended for
  tracing only the <i>write()</i> syscall, however it captures any write, and the writes with a single character
  are not of interest to me, so maybe we can filter this out too. I didn't see any option to filter on
  arguments, so its time to proceed to the stack tracing option of <i>strace</i>. The full command is
  <strong>sudo strace --stack-traces --trace=write --attach=&lt;pid&gt;</strong>. This actually worked
  rather nicely, it was producing stack traces, which I had to remind myself are read from bottom to top,
  terminating on the <i>write()</i> syscall.
