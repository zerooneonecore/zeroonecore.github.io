  <h1>Tracing programs, maybe gdb</h1><br>
  
  Anyway, so lets trace some syscalls with strace, lets trace gdb. First of all, running the command
  <strong>strace gdb</strong> will make gdb unuseable, it will essentially just completely take over
  standard output. The better way to go about it is <strong>strace --attach=&lt;pid&gt;</strong>, then you will be
  privy to the sea of output from strace. So first of all we know that we want to trace only the <strong>write()</strong>
  system call, so maybe strace can be filtered on its system calls.
