  <h1>gdb, a debugger</h1><br>
  <p>How did gdb even work? being able to use a debugger depends on being able to load that file, I
    downloaded the source and did a recursive grep for <strong>"run"</strong>, this was not fruitful
    to say the least. 'run' is an extremely common name, but I had an idea, the error message that
    <i>run</i> returned was <i>During startup program exited with code 127.</i>I might be able to
    grep for where this interfaces with the rest of the program. This turned up results, but
    annoyingly, the string was referenced in gdbs 'testsuite' files, indicating a possibility that
    this may not be its legitimate functionality. Still, the string was referenced in <i><strong>.exp</strong></i> files, 
    so I decided to see if looking into <i><strong>.exp</strong></i> files yielded anything,
    this didn't work either. I knew gdb used the readline library, and that it must be using it when
    reading commands typed into gdb. I read the readline documentation, and noticed this line,
    <p class="source"><i>Variable: char * rl_line_buffer<br>
      This is the line gathered so far. You are welcome to modify the contents of the line</i></p><br>
    This indicated that this was a variable that would be modified by the user of the library, which in this
  case was gdb. Grepping for this led to <strong>gdb/gdbcmd.h</strong>, which in itself indicated another
  interesting line.<br>
  <br><p class="source"><i>/* Chain containing all defined commands.<br>
    extern struct cmd_list_element *cmdlist;</i>
    </p><br>
  So gdb must be keeping the commands in a linked list. I had now found the <strong>gdb/cli-cmds.c</strong> file
  and noticed a function returning a string ,
  <i>error (_("The \"pwd\" command does not take an argument: %s"), args);</i> As an acid test, I ran
  the <i>pwd</i> command with an argument within gdb, and it indeed returned,
  <strong><i>The "pwd" command does not take an argument: s</i></strong>, this was a good sign that I was
  in the right place. Now all I had to do was find the <i>run</i> command. Yet, like some manifestation
  of murphys law, the <i>run</i> command proved elusive, it was not in that file at all...
