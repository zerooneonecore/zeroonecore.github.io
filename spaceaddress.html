<p>There are different ways of concieving of the 'address space', of a program,
   We could refer to the metadata the program assigns to divisions of memory or
   Whether that memory is protected in some fashion or not, we will start with the latter
   The easiest way to see memory protections is via the /proc file system, and the
   /proc/<pid>/maps file, which will display the memory map for the process referred to
   by the <pid> argument.
  <span>We have sample output here: <i>55aa0fee0000-55aa0ff01000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0 [heap]</i></span>
  However how do we know how to interpret the addresses? one tempting avenue is to
  assume that the address has preserved the endianness, which is a dangerous assumption, as this
  is rendered output and not read directly from a register or memory for example.
