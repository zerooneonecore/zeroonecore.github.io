<p>There are different ways of concieving of the 'address space', of a program,
   We could refer to the metadata the program assigns to divisions of memory or
   Whether that memory is protected in some fashion or not, we will start with the latter
   The easiest way to see memory protections is via the /proc file system, and the
   /proc/<pid>/maps file, which will display the memory map for the process referred to
   by the <pid> argument.
